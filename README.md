# VEAF Foothold Caucasus

## Presentation

This is a modification of the original [Foothold Caucasus](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/3341245/) mission by Lekaa, that I adapted to make it load all the script files and config directly from the server.

**Done using the latest version updated on 2025-09-01.**

## Things to do

- [x] silence all ATC
- [ ] add VEAF radio presets
- [ ] check why the wind is sometimes wrong (0 kn instead of 10-15 kn)
- [x] disable the no fly zone (or make it less punitive)
- [ ] no waypoints for an f18 spawned on cvn74
- [ ] limited spawn spots on Batumi
